# driveway
CalHacks 6.0 project

A web application based on the idea of Airbnb, where users can rent out space in their driveway or parking garage to people looking for a place to park their car. 
In many large cities such as San Francisco or Los Angeles, parking spots are hard to find and can be quite expensive. Additionally, many people that commute to work via car often have space in their driveways during certain times of the day. 
People could make extra money while away from home by simply renting out space in their driveways for others to park their cars.
